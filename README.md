# John Carmack .plan Archive

Mirror of the John Carmack .plan Archive [on floodyberry.com](http://floodyberry.com/carmack/plan.html). These are the exports of ZIP files for his .plan files, organized by day and year.

If you appreciate this archive, then I would appreciate it if you checked out [NTRPD](https://ntrpd.com), my digital product studio, and [Reorient](https://reorient.guide), my digital nomad event and workation aggregator.
